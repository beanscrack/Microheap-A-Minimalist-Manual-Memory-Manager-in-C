# C-Manual-Memory-Management
This project implements a **manual memory management system** in C â€” a simplified "heap allocator" that emulates how low-level allocators work underneath `malloc` and `free`. It manages a contiguous memory block with explicit tracking of allocated and free regions using linked metadata structures.
